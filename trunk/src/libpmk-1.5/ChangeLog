Version 1.5:
	- Fix the behavior of GlobalVGPyramidMaker to explicitly compute
	furthest pairs for bin size calculations.(thanks Kristen Grauman)
	
Version 1.4:
	- KMeansClusterer will now return fewer than K clusters if the
	input data contains less than K unique points (in such a case it
	will return a number of clusters equal to the number of unique
	points).
	- Fix bug in Tree::DeleteNode() when deleting an only child.
	- Fix potential access error in Histogram::SortBins() on some
	platforms (thanks Yiqun Hu)
	- New default behavior of Feature's constructor is to set the
	initial weight to 1, not 0 (thanks Ravi Kiran)

Version 1.3:
	- Internal changes to Tree and TreeNode for faster processing.
	- Removed Tree::DepthFirstIterator and replaced it with
	PreOrderIterator and PostOrderIterator.
	- Added the ability to copy Trees.
	- Added Tree::DeleteNode(), which deletes a specified node as well
	as all children nodes.
	- Added a "merging" copy constructor to Tree which takes 2 trees
	and returns one big merged tree.
	- Minor fixes to Clusterer (more const member functions)
	- Clusterer has a new function, GetNumCenters().
	- Allow a UniformPyramidMaker to be constructed with a vector of
	PointRefs (in addition to a PointSetList)
	- PointSets now have the ability to serialize themselves (before,
	that was all handled by PointSetList).
	- The pointsets-to-uniform-pyramids tool takes less memory by
	keeping all of the PointSetLists on disk.
	- Added more user-friendly output to the tools. 
	- Fixed some compilation errors on gcc-4.1.1.

Version 1.2:
	- Added depth-first and breadth-first iterators to Tree.
	- Added ReadFromFile() and WriteToFile() convenience functions for
	most classes that support serialization.

Version 1.1:
	- KernelMatrix now uses doubles to store data, rather than floats.
	- Added a Matrix class, which is just a rectangular 2D array of
	doubles.
	- Added a new constructor to Experiment, which allows one to pass
	in data in two separate pieces (training and testing), so you no
	longer have to compute kernel values between the test examples if
	you know which ones they are.
	- Added ProbSVMExperiment, another SVM experiment example, which
	reports the posterior probabilities of each class for each test
	example.
	- Added a new Tree class template and TreeNode, which lets you
	create custom tree-like structures. MultiResolutionHistogram has
	been rewritten as a wrapper around Tree, but its interface has not
	changed (all changes are transparent).
		
Version 1.0:
	- Initial release
